Today we had tried 4 stemmers in class and were asked to make few observations.


Porter Stemmer:
It works with a switch-case algorithm, with cases defined for consonant-vowel combination, and just chops for the suffixes for the match.

Snowball Stemmer:(Porter stemmer 2) supports 16 languages (for the version used)
A improved version of Porter Stemmer

Lancaster Stemmer: Better than what Porter 

Regex Stemmer

Few observations.
1) All the three failed for "sibling"
2) Lancaster worked for "fortification"
3) Porter And Snowball seem to be verb-oriented
